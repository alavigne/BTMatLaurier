<h5> BTM stands for Business Technology Management. BTM is all about giving students the abilities to bridge the gap between Business and technology, and how to manage them cohesively. Technology is playing an increasingly pivotal role in every industry and it is shaping our world. Traditional business skills are not enough to keep students competitive coming out of post-secondary education. The BTM program merges the importance of business skill and knowledge with the skills and practices of information technology to give students a well-rounded set of skills that enables them to work in extremely broad categories of industries.   <h5 />
